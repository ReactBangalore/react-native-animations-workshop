### Performance Tips
- ShouldComponentUpdate   
- UseNativeDriver = true
- Use interpolation rather than parallal and sequence Animations
- Avoid animating height and width, use scaleX and scaleY instead
- Use this line to make animations work in Android: <span>"UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental && UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental(true)"</span>
- Use removeClippedSubview = true (reduce memory)
- Lazy = true, createBottomTabNavigator react navigation
- Avoid to use componentDidUpdate
