### Performance Tips
- shouldComponentUpdate
- useNativeDriver = true
- use interpolation rather than parallal and sequence Animations
- Avoid animating height and width, use scaleX and scaleY instead
- use this line to make animations work in Android: <h6>"UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental && UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental(true)"</h6>
